TDD Exercises
=============

This project contains a collection of katas for practicing Test Driven Development. 

Setup
-----

1. Run ``./gradlew idea``.
2. Open the project in IDEA.

String Calculator
-----------------

We recommend starting out with `string-calculator` because there are instructions available [online](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/). 

Follow those instructions, adding as many features as you have time for.

Tennis Score
------------

Add your tests and implementation in the `tennis-score` directory. We have not provided an initial test file, which you should create yourself at the start.

If you are unclear with the rules of tennis then find them online. You can extend this session by (for example) considering how many Deuces have occurred or implementing 'sets' and 'matches'.

Bowling Game
------------

Google the rules if you don't know them!
